1
00:00:18,602 --> 00:00:21,146
<i>Bo-Katan</i>
<i>sent me to talk to you.</i>

2
00:00:22,648 --> 00:00:23,982
I hope it's about him.

3
00:00:26,276 --> 00:00:28,362
<i>Grogu and I</i>
<i>can feel each other's thoughts.</i>

4
00:00:28,445 --> 00:00:29,446
<i>Grogu?</i>

5
00:00:29,947 --> 00:00:32,241
<i>Yes. That's his name.</i>

6
00:00:33,033 --> 00:00:35,494
<i>I've been quested</i>
<i>to bring him to his kind.</i>

7
00:00:35,994 --> 00:00:38,330
<i>I must deliver him to a Jedi.</i>

8
00:00:39,289 --> 00:00:40,791
Go to the planet Tython.

9
00:00:41,375 --> 00:00:43,418
There, you will find
the ancient ruins of a Temple

10
00:00:43,502 --> 00:00:45,420
that has a strong connection to the Force.

11
00:00:46,505 --> 00:00:49,049
Place Grogu on the seeing stone
at the top of the mountain.

12
00:00:49,675 --> 00:00:51,426
If he reaches out through the Force,

13
00:00:51,510 --> 00:00:55,472
there's a chance a Jedi may sense
his presence and come searching for him.

14
00:01:04,690 --> 00:01:05,858
Moff Gideon.

15
00:01:08,735 --> 00:01:11,363
The tracking beacon
has been installed on the <i>Razor Crest.</i>

16
00:01:11,446 --> 00:01:13,156
Does he still have the asset?

17
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:15,200
Our source confirmed it.

18
00:02:02,956 --> 00:02:04,541
Grogu.

19
00:02:11,798 --> 00:02:12,799
Grogu?

20
00:02:17,012 --> 00:02:18,013
Give me the ball.

21
00:02:20,641 --> 00:02:23,435
Grogu, give me the ball.

22
00:02:24,436 --> 00:02:25,437
Come on.

23
00:02:31,693 --> 00:02:33,195
Okay, here we go.

24
00:02:36,198 --> 00:02:38,450
You can have it, just like before.

25
00:02:42,788 --> 00:02:45,165
Grogu, come on. You can have it.

26
00:02:49,378 --> 00:02:50,671
Come on.

27
00:02:53,507 --> 00:02:55,175
<i>- Dank farrik!</i>

28
00:02:57,010 --> 00:03:00,138
Hey, no. I'm not mad at you.
You did good.

29
00:03:00,722 --> 00:03:01,723
I just...

30
00:03:02,683 --> 00:03:05,394
When the nice lady said
you had training, I just...

31
00:03:13,569 --> 00:03:16,280
You're very special, kid.

32
00:03:17,281 --> 00:03:19,700
We're gonna find that place you belong

33
00:03:19,783 --> 00:03:21,827
and they're gonna take
real good care of you.

34
00:03:27,249 --> 00:03:28,625
This is Tython.

35
00:03:28,709 --> 00:03:31,170
That's where we're gonna
try and find you a Jedi.

36
00:03:32,337 --> 00:03:36,550
But you have to agree to go with them
if they want you to. Understand?

37
00:03:38,719 --> 00:03:40,220
Plus, I can't train you.

38
00:03:40,929 --> 00:03:42,347
You're too powerful.

39
00:03:44,266 --> 00:03:46,435
Don't you wanna learn
more of that Jedi stuff?

40
00:03:50,564 --> 00:03:52,733
I agreed to take you back
to your own kind,

41
00:03:52,816 --> 00:03:54,193
so that's what I need to do.

42
00:03:55,402 --> 00:03:56,403
You understand, right?

43
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:39,947
Looks like that's the magic rock
I'm supposed to take you to down there.

44
00:04:59,925 --> 00:05:02,010
Sorry, buddy. I can't land on the top.

45
00:05:02,094 --> 00:05:03,095
Too small.

46
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:06,849
We're gonna have to travel
the last stretch with the windows down.

47
00:05:38,630 --> 00:05:40,507
Well, I guess this is it.

48
00:05:52,227 --> 00:05:53,979
Does this look Jedi to you?

49
00:06:03,947 --> 00:06:05,532
I guess you sit right here.

50
00:06:11,914 --> 00:06:13,624
Okay. Here we go.

51
00:06:16,460 --> 00:06:19,254
This is the seeing stone,
are you seeing anything?

52
00:06:22,132 --> 00:06:24,134
Or are they supposed to see you?

53
00:06:27,930 --> 00:06:32,184
Maybe there's
some kind of control or something.

54
00:06:50,994 --> 00:06:52,162
Come on, kid.

55
00:06:52,829 --> 00:06:55,791
Ahsoka told me all I had to do
was get you here and you'd do the rest.

56
00:07:30,534 --> 00:07:32,661
Time's up, kid. We gotta get out of here.

57
00:07:37,666 --> 00:07:40,460
We don't have time for this.
We got to get...

58
00:07:45,340 --> 00:07:47,926
Hey! Snap out of it, kid!

59
00:07:48,635 --> 00:07:50,137
We got to get out of here!

60
00:08:11,283 --> 00:08:13,243
I'll see if I can buy you some time.

61
00:08:13,327 --> 00:08:15,037
Can you please hurry up?

62
00:08:43,065 --> 00:08:44,900
I've been tracking you, Mandalorian.

63
00:08:59,081 --> 00:09:00,207
Are you Jedi?

64
00:09:03,752 --> 00:09:05,420
Or are you after the Child?

65
00:09:16,390 --> 00:09:17,683
I'm here for the armor.

66
00:09:19,017 --> 00:09:22,020
If you want my armor,
you'll have to peel it off my dead body.

67
00:09:24,857 --> 00:09:26,316
I don't want your armor.

68
00:09:27,526 --> 00:09:31,947
I want my armor that you got
from Cobb Vanth back on Tatooine.

69
00:09:32,447 --> 00:09:33,657
It belongs to me.

70
00:09:35,242 --> 00:09:36,660
Are you Mandalorian?

71
00:09:37,452 --> 00:09:40,205
I'm a simple man
making his way through the galaxy.

72
00:09:41,081 --> 00:09:43,083
Like my father before me.

73
00:09:43,834 --> 00:09:45,169
Did you take the Creed?

74
00:09:46,253 --> 00:09:48,463
I give my allegiance to no one.

75
00:09:48,964 --> 00:09:51,592
The beskar belongs to the Mandalorians.

76
00:09:51,675 --> 00:09:53,802
It was looted from us during the Purge.

77
00:09:53,886 --> 00:09:55,679
The armor was my father's.

78
00:09:56,305 --> 00:09:57,556
Now it's mine.

79
00:09:57,639 --> 00:10:00,809
What's to stop me
from dropping you right where you stand?

80
00:10:00,893 --> 00:10:03,729
Because I have
a sharpshooter up on that ridge

81
00:10:04,438 --> 00:10:07,983
with a locked scope that will unload
by the time my body hits the ground.

82
00:10:08,984 --> 00:10:10,736
I'm the one wearing beskar.

83
00:10:10,819 --> 00:10:14,281
As soon as I see that muzzle flash,
you're both dead.

84
00:10:14,364 --> 00:10:16,825
I didn't mean she was going to shoot you.

85
00:10:17,618 --> 00:10:21,747
My friend's locked onto that
little companion of yours up on the henge.

86
00:10:22,497 --> 00:10:25,125
And if you remember,
I don't miss.

87
00:10:25,209 --> 00:10:26,210
Fennec?

88
00:10:26,293 --> 00:10:28,253
You have a keen ear, Mando.

89
00:10:32,925 --> 00:10:35,219
You point
that gun away from the kid

90
00:10:35,302 --> 00:10:36,887
or I'll drop you both where you stand.

91
00:10:38,430 --> 00:10:41,391
Let's all put down
our weapons, have a chat.

92
00:10:42,100 --> 00:10:43,602
There's no need for bloodshed.

93
00:10:43,685 --> 00:10:45,395
Tell her to drop the gun.

94
00:10:45,479 --> 00:10:47,314
After you put down the jetpack.

95
00:10:48,524 --> 00:10:49,525
Same time.

96
00:10:51,401 --> 00:10:52,444
Stand down.

97
00:11:14,967 --> 00:11:16,927
You look like you've just seen a ghost.

98
00:11:17,010 --> 00:11:18,428
You were dead.

99
00:11:18,512 --> 00:11:23,183
She was left for dead
on the sands of Tatooine, as was I.

100
00:11:24,101 --> 00:11:27,354
But fate sometimes steps in
to rescue the wretched.

101
00:11:27,437 --> 00:11:31,900
In my case, Boba Fett was that fate.

102
00:11:34,528 --> 00:11:35,821
And I am now in his service.

103
00:11:37,906 --> 00:11:39,116
I want my armor back.

104
00:11:39,950 --> 00:11:42,327
It goes against
the Mandalorian Creed.

105
00:11:42,411 --> 00:11:46,331
The armor was given
to my father, Jango, by your forebears.

106
00:11:46,915 --> 00:11:51,003
In exchange, I guarantee the safety
of the Child, as well as your own.

107
00:11:51,503 --> 00:11:54,798
The bounty on your little friend
has risen significantly.

108
00:11:54,882 --> 00:11:57,718
You can buy ten suits of armor
for the price on its head.

109
00:11:57,801 --> 00:12:01,054
I'd say we're offering a fair deal
under the circumstances.

110
00:12:26,705 --> 00:12:28,957
Time to go, kid!

111
00:13:04,993 --> 00:13:07,120
Go, go!
Advance and take...

112
00:13:17,339 --> 00:13:18,715
Up top. Move out!

113
00:13:33,438 --> 00:13:35,190
Flank left and from above.

114
00:13:35,274 --> 00:13:36,525
Sir, there's too much fire!

115
00:13:36,608 --> 00:13:37,985
Flank them, you idiot!

116
00:13:39,528 --> 00:13:41,196
Up top! Get up there!

117
00:15:28,512 --> 00:15:32,516
One, two...

118
00:15:39,439 --> 00:15:41,525
Get back! Get...

119
00:15:50,033 --> 00:15:51,326
Go, go!

120
00:16:05,674 --> 00:16:07,092
No.

121
00:17:00,896 --> 00:17:02,981
Flank left. Move out!

122
00:17:03,065 --> 00:17:04,525
That's it, kid.

123
00:17:04,608 --> 00:17:05,984
We got to get out of here!

124
00:17:20,123 --> 00:17:21,542
Okay, I'm gonna protect you.

125
00:17:22,251 --> 00:17:24,670
Just stay there. I'll be back soon.

126
00:17:48,986 --> 00:17:50,612
Give yourselves up!

127
00:17:50,904 --> 00:17:52,948
We don't want you, we want the Child.

128
00:17:59,746 --> 00:18:01,373
Okay, let's move in.

129
00:18:03,876 --> 00:18:05,419
This isn't looking good.

130
00:18:06,003 --> 00:18:07,462
I've seen worse.

131
00:18:08,505 --> 00:18:11,133
You can get out of here.
I owe you from last time.

132
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:12,885
We have a deal.

133
00:19:06,897 --> 00:19:08,815
Back to the ship!
Back to the ship!

134
00:19:13,028 --> 00:19:14,321
Go! Go!

135
00:19:51,316 --> 00:19:52,359
Nice shot.

136
00:19:52,901 --> 00:19:54,486
I was aiming for the other one.

137
00:20:10,460 --> 00:20:11,712
Better get to your ship.

138
00:20:23,265 --> 00:20:24,266
The kid!

139
00:20:30,606 --> 00:20:31,648
Direct hit.

140
00:20:32,608 --> 00:20:34,776
Have the dark troopers been engaged?

141
00:20:37,112 --> 00:20:38,113
Momentarily.

142
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:57,734
<i>They've got the baby.</i>

143
00:21:57,818 --> 00:21:59,027
<i>Don't let them get away!</i>

144
00:21:59,111 --> 00:22:00,112
Affirmative.

145
00:22:02,698 --> 00:22:03,782
I have a lock.

146
00:22:03,866 --> 00:22:05,158
Stop him.

147
00:22:05,242 --> 00:22:06,535
I don't want the Child hurt.

148
00:22:06,994 --> 00:22:08,871
<i>Abort pursuit. Disengage.</i>

149
00:22:08,954 --> 00:22:10,414
Do not harm the Child.

150
00:22:10,497 --> 00:22:13,876
Copy. I'll do a loose follow,
see where they're headed.

151
00:22:35,564 --> 00:22:37,274
- They're back.
<i>- Who?</i>

152
00:22:37,941 --> 00:22:39,026
The Empire.

153
00:22:39,484 --> 00:22:40,652
They're back.

154
00:22:40,736 --> 00:22:41,737
<i>That can't be.</i>

155
00:22:42,112 --> 00:22:44,781
The Outer Rim is under
the jurisdiction of the New Republic.

156
00:22:44,865 --> 00:22:46,700
This isn't a spice dream.

157
00:22:47,201 --> 00:22:49,995
I can see the Imperial cruiser
with my own eyes.

158
00:22:51,455 --> 00:22:52,623
Heading down.

159
00:24:11,243 --> 00:24:13,120
This is all that survived.

160
00:24:13,912 --> 00:24:14,955
Beskar.

161
00:24:17,249 --> 00:24:19,209
I want you to take a look at something.

162
00:24:21,044 --> 00:24:24,965
My chain code has been encoded
in this armor for 25 years.

163
00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:29,303
You see, this is me. Boba Fett.

164
00:24:30,470 --> 00:24:31,972
This is my father, Jango Fett.

165
00:24:34,725 --> 00:24:36,435
Your father was a foundling.

166
00:24:36,518 --> 00:24:37,561
Yes.

167
00:24:38,228 --> 00:24:41,064
He even fought
in the Mandalorian Civil Wars.

168
00:24:41,982 --> 00:24:44,067
Then that armor belongs to you.

169
00:24:45,652 --> 00:24:47,196
I appreciate its return.

170
00:24:48,655 --> 00:24:50,490
Then our deal is complete.

171
00:24:50,866 --> 00:24:52,034
Not quite.

172
00:24:52,117 --> 00:24:53,118
How so?

173
00:24:54,328 --> 00:24:57,372
We agreed in exchange
for the return of my armor,

174
00:24:57,456 --> 00:24:59,416
we will ensure the safety of the Child.

175
00:25:00,250 --> 00:25:01,627
The Child's gone.

176
00:25:02,628 --> 00:25:05,672
Until he is returned to you safely,
we are in your debt.

177
00:25:32,282 --> 00:25:35,035
Cara Dune,
Marshal of the New Republic.

178
00:25:37,079 --> 00:25:38,997
I heard rumors you might have gone legit.

179
00:25:39,081 --> 00:25:40,707
I wouldn't go that far.

180
00:25:42,125 --> 00:25:43,210
I need your help.

181
00:25:43,710 --> 00:25:44,711
Name it.

182
00:25:44,795 --> 00:25:47,339
I need you to locate someone
in the prison registry.

183
00:25:48,257 --> 00:25:49,508
Let's see what I can do.

184
00:25:52,427 --> 00:25:55,430
Ex-Imperial sharpshooter,
last name Mayfeld.

185
00:25:56,181 --> 00:25:59,309
Apprehended near the Dilestri system
on a derelict prison ship.

186
00:26:01,228 --> 00:26:02,354
Migs Mayfeld.

187
00:26:03,063 --> 00:26:05,607
Serving 50 years
in the Karthon Chop Fields

188
00:26:05,691 --> 00:26:07,359
for springing a prisoner himself.

189
00:26:08,193 --> 00:26:10,404
Accessory to the death
of a New Republic officer.

190
00:26:10,487 --> 00:26:12,072
Sounds like a real piece of work.

191
00:26:12,155 --> 00:26:13,782
What do you want with him?

192
00:26:13,866 --> 00:26:17,411
I need to spring him to help me
locate Moff Gideon's light cruiser.

193
00:26:18,829 --> 00:26:20,706
You know how I feel about the Empire.

194
00:26:21,540 --> 00:26:22,583
But these stripes...

195
00:26:23,417 --> 00:26:25,169
mean there are rules I need to follow.

196
00:26:28,255 --> 00:26:29,381
They have the kid.

197
00:27:28,106 --> 00:27:29,525
- Set to stun.
- Wait.

198
00:27:49,002 --> 00:27:50,754
You've gotten very good with that.

199
00:27:51,463 --> 00:27:55,384
But it makes you so sleepy.

200
00:27:57,594 --> 00:27:59,388
Have you ever seen one of these?

201
00:28:01,807 --> 00:28:03,475
From years past?

202
00:28:14,361 --> 00:28:16,572
You're not ready to play with such things.

203
00:28:16,655 --> 00:28:18,699
Liable to put an eye out
with one of these.

204
00:28:20,117 --> 00:28:23,954
Looks like you could use
a nice, long sleep.

205
00:28:31,044 --> 00:28:32,045
Put it in shackles.

206
00:28:35,883 --> 00:28:37,509
When we come out of hyperspace,

207
00:28:37,593 --> 00:28:40,012
send an encrypted message to Dr. Pershing.

208
00:28:40,095 --> 00:28:42,514
Let him know we have got our donor.

209
00:28:42,598 --> 00:28:43,682
Yes, sir.
